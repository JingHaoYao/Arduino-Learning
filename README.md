# Arduino-Learning
Here, you'll find all my projects that I have created and completed during the summer of 2018. Every project was completed using an Arduino kit, and coded in Arduino's language (C/C++) using their IDE. 

If you want to see the circuitry for these projects, I created interactable schematics here:
